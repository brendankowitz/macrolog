### Key Features Implemented

✅ **AI-Powered Analysis**
- GPT-4o vision model
- Identifies multiple food items
- Estimates portions and units
- Calculates full macros per item
- 3-factor health scoring
- Personalized encouragement messages

✅ **Health Score System**
- Nutrient Density (33%): Vitamins, minerals, fiber
- Processing Level (33%): Whole vs processed foods
- Goal Alignment (34%): Fit with user's targets
- Per-item and meal-level scores
- Color-coded badges (green/blue/yellow/orange)

✅ **Contextual Encouragement**
- Oura Ring-style positive feedback

- Efficient base64 conversion
- References stored in meal objects
- Ready for future Apple Health sync

### Technical Implementation

**New Dependencies Added:**
- `expo-file-system` - Image processing
- `@react-navigation/stack` - Modal navigation

**API Integration:**
```typescript
OpenAIService.analyzeMealPhoto(
  base64Image,
  apiKey,
  dailyGoals
) => FoodItem[]
```

**Data Flow:**
```
Photo URI
  → Base64
  → OpenAI API
  → FoodItem[]
  → User Review
  → Save to Storage
  → Update Streak
  → Check Achievements
  → Refresh UI
```

### What's Working

1. ✅ Camera capture with permissions
2. ✅ Image-to-base64 conversion
3. ✅ OpenAI Vision API integration
4. ✅ JSON parsing of AI response
5. ✅ Health score calculations
6. ✅ Encouragement message generation
7. ✅ Full editing interface
8. ✅ Meal saving with all metadata
9. ✅ Streak calculation and updates
10. ✅ Achievement unlock detection
11. ✅ Photo storage to filesystem
12. ✅ Navigation flow (5 screens)
13. ✅ Error handling throughout
14. ✅ Loading states
15. ✅ Success confirmation

## Next: Phase 3 - Apple Health Integration

The app is now **fully functional** for core meal logging! The only missing piece is Apple Health sync, which will be Phase 3.

### To Test the App:

```bash
cd macrolog-app
npm start
# Press 'i' for iOS simulator or scan QR code
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Go to Settings
2. Add your OpenAI API key
3. Set daily goals
4. Go to Home
5. Tap Camera button
6. Take photo of food
7. Wait for AI analysis (~3-5 seconds)
8. Review results & edit if needed
9. Tap "Log Meal"
10. See success screen
11. Return to home - see meal logged!
12. Check Progress tab for stats

### Phase 3 TODO:
- [ ] Install HealthKit library
- [ ] Request permissions
- [ ] Write nutrition data to Apple Health
- [ ] Handle sync errors
- [ ] Add sync status indicators
