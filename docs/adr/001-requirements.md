# ADR 001: MacroLog Requirements and Architecture

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Decision Makers:** Product Team
**Related:** Initial project scope

## Context

We are building MacroLog, a React Native iOS application that simplifies macro tracking by combining AI-powered food photo analysis with Apple Health integration. The goal is to create a frictionless experience where users can photograph their meals, receive instant nutritional analysis with health ratings, and seamlessly sync data with Apple Health.

### Current State
- Web-based prototype exists (phototype/food-tracker-v2.jsx) demonstrating core UI/UX patterns
- Basic health scoring implemented (0-100 scale with ratings: Nutritious/Good/Fair/Limited)
- 7-day progress tracking UI
- Daily goal tracking and visualization

### Required Enhancements
Based on user feedback, the following features need to be added:
1. **7-Day Progress Checks**: Enhanced goal achievement tracking to see if daily targets are met
2. **Historical Navigation**: Ability to scroll through meal history across different dates
3. **Enhanced Health Rating**: Oura Ring-style comprehensive health scoring with multiple dimensions

## Requirements

### 1. Functional Requirements

#### 1.1 Core Features

**F1.1 - Photo Capture & Analysis**
- Users can capture photos of meals using device camera
- Photos are analyzed using OpenAI Vision API for food identification
- AI returns food items with quantities, units, and macro breakdown (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
- Analysis requires active internet connection (online-only mode)
- User can review and edit AI-identified items before logging

**F1.2 - Apple Health Integration**
- **Write**: Log nutrition data (calories, protein, carbs, fat) to Apple Health
- **Read**: Import existing nutrition data from Apple Health (if needed for historical context)
- Request appropriate HealthKit permissions on first launch
- Sync nutrition data immediately upon meal confirmation

**F1.3 - Enhanced Health Rating System**
- Each food item receives a health score (0-100) based on multiple factors:
  - **Nutrient Density** (33%): Vitamins, minerals, fiber content
  - **Processing Level** (33%): Whole foods vs processed/packaged foods
  - **Goal Alignment** (34%): How well item fits user's daily macro/calorie goals
- Meal-level health score calculated as weighted average of all items
- Daily health score calculated as average of all meals
- Visual indicators:
  - 90-100: "Nutritious" (green, üåü)
  - 70-89: "Good" (blue, ‚úÖ)
  - 50-69: "Fair" (yellow, üëç)
  - 0-49: "Limited" (orange, ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- **Contextual Encouragement** (Oura-style): AI generates personalized, balanced feedback for each item
  - Highlights positive nutritional aspects
  - Gently notes areas for improvement
  - Encouraging and non-judgmental tone
  - Example: "Your protein shake is excellent for muscle recovery with 25g protein, though it's highly processed. Consider pairing with whole foods for added nutrients."
  - Example: "Grilled chicken is a lean protein powerhouse! Great choice for meeting your goals."
  - Example: "This pizza provides energy but is high in processed carbs and sodium. Balance it with vegetables or save room for a nutrient-dense meal later."

**F1.4 - History & Navigation**
- Users can navigate through historical meal data by date
- Date picker with previous/next day navigation
- View all meals logged on a specific date
- Scroll back through unlimited historical data
- Display meal photos, timestamps, nutrition totals, and health scores

**F1.5 - 7-Day Progress Tracking**
- Dashboard showing last 7 days of tracking
- Daily goal achievement indicators:
  - ‚úÖ Goal met (within 90-110% of target calories)
  - üìä Logged but goal not met
  - No indicator for days with no data
- Visual progress bars for calories vs goals
- Per-day breakdown of meals, calories, macros, and health rating
- Click/tap any day to view detailed meal history

**F1.6 - Daily Goal Management**
- Users set custom daily targets:
  - Total calories
  - Protein (grams)
  - Carbohydrates (grams)
  - Fat (grams)
- Goals persist across sessions
- Visual comparison of actual vs goal in all views

**F1.7 - Streak Tracking & Achievements**
- Track consecutive days of meal logging (streak counter)
- A "day" counts toward streak if user logs at least one meal
- Streak resets to 0 if a day is missed (no meals logged)
- Display current streak prominently on Home and Progress screens
- Achievement milestones with badges/celebrations:
  - üî• **7 Days**: "Week Warrior" - One full week of consistency
  - ‚≠ê **21 Days**: "Habit Builder" - Three weeks of tracking
  - üí™ **35 Days**: "Streak Master" - Five weeks strong
  - üèÜ **50 Days**: "Dedication" - 50 days of commitment
  - üíé **100 Days**: "Century Club" - 100 days milestone
  - üëë **365 Days**: "Year Champion" - Full year of tracking
- Achievement unlocks trigger celebration animations/confetti
- View all achievements (locked/unlocked) in Settings or dedicated screen
- Personal best streak tracking (highest streak ever achieved)

**Accuracy**
- % of meals edited before logging (target: < 30%)
- User feedback on AI accuracy

**Health Impact**
- Average daily health score trend
- % of days meeting goals

**Technical**
- Average analysis time
- Apple Health sync success rate
- App crash rate

### 9. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Android support
- Barcode scanning for packaged foods
- Manual meal entry (no photo)
- Recipe builder
- Social features / meal sharing
- Nutritionist AI chat
- Integration with fitness trackers
- Meal planning and suggestions
- Export data to CSV/PDF

## Decision

We will proceed with building MacroLog as a React Native iOS app using Expo EAS Build with the requirements and architecture outlined above. The app will focus on:

1. Frictionless photo-based macro logging with AI
2. Comprehensive health rating system with contextual encouragement (Oura-style)
3. Apple Health integration for nutrition data
4. Local photo storage with historical navigation
5. Enhanced 7-day progress tracking with goal indicators
6. Streak tracking and achievement system for motivation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear technical direction and scope
- Proven technology stack (React Native + Expo)
- User controls their data and API costs
- Seamless iOS ecosystem integration
- Rich health insights beyond basic macro tracking

### Negative
- Requires users to provide OpenAI API key (friction)
- Online-only for analysis (no offline meal logging)
- iOS-only limits potential user base
- Photo storage could grow large over time

### Neutral
- Need to maintain single codebase for mobile
- Dependent on OpenAI API stability and pricing
- HealthKit requires native module integration

## Notes

- The web prototype (phototype/food-tracker-v2.jsx) serves as the UI/UX reference
- Health rating algorithm may need tuning based on user feedback
- Consider adding workout/exercise tracking in future versions to provide more holistic health picture
